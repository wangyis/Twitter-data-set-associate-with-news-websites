# Twitter-data-set-associate-with-news-websites
We built a data set containing data from Twitter associate with major news websites for further study such as opinion formation and echo chamber. We also uploaded the data to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)) and keep it up to date. The repo contains the data we collected as well as the source code for extracting the data.

Bribe. Lie. Here\'s how the college admissions scam allegedly worked\n\nHuffman, the "Desperate Housewives" star, pleaded guilty to paying $15,000 to\na fake charity associated with Rick Singer to facilitate cheating for her\ndaughter on the SATs, the complaint says.\n\nRead More\n\n"I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what\nI have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the\nconsequences that stem from those actions," she said in a statement.\n\n"I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my\ncolleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and,\nespecially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get\ninto college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support\ntheir children and do so honestly.\n\n"My daughter knew absolutely nothing about my actions, and in my misguided and\nprofoundly wrong way, I have betrayed her. This transgression toward her and\nthe public I will carry for the rest of my life. My desire to help my daughter\nis no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty," she said in the\nstatement.\n\nProsecutors will be asking for jail time for all defendants, according to a\nlaw enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. Huffman, Lori\nLoughlin and other defendants are facing anywhere between six to 21 months in\nprison if convicted or if they plead guilty, the official added, though the\nexact sentence would depend on a number of factors.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by CompareCards\n\n  * ### 9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt\n\n  * ### Transfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### Fly practically free with these 3 travel cards\n\n  * ### Getting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent credit\n\n## Content by LendingTree\n\n  * ### How to pay off your house ASAP (It\'s so simple)\n\n  * ### Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1,608/mo\n\n  * ### Need cash?

"Any credits earned have also been\nvacated. The student is no longer on Stanford\'s campus."\n\nThe student is not named in the statement or in court documents.\n\nStanford sailing coach John Vandemoer pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy\nto commit racketeering for arranging bribes of $110,000 and $160,000 to the\nsailing program in exchange for falsely designating two applicants as sailing\nrecruits. Neither of the students had competitive sailing experience, the\ncriminal complaint states.\n\nThe money was funneled from wealthy parents to a charity run by Rick Singer,\nwho then directed the payments to Vandemoer, according to the complaint.\n\nRead More\n\nHowever, neither of those students completed the application process, so\nneither were admitted nor enrolled at the school, Stanford said.\n\nUSC says students connected to cheating scheme will be denied admission\n\nA third student, though, was associated with a contribution to Stanford\'s\nsailing program from the charity central to the scam, known as Key Worldwide\nFoundation, Stanford said.\n\n"The contribution was made several months after the student was admitted to\nStanford. The student had no recommendation from the former sailing coach, or\nany other coach, and has not at any time had an affiliation with the Stanford\nsailing program or any other Stanford athletic team," Stanford said.\n\nStanford said KWF contributed a total of $770,000 to the sailing program in\nthe form of three separate gifts. Given that the two students who did not\nenroll were associated with gifts of $110,000 and $160,000 to the sailing\nprogram, the third student was therefore associated with a gift of $500,000.\n\nStanford is the second school to expel a student as part of the fallout of the\ncollege admissions scam. Yale University kicked out a student two weeks ago\nwhose family paid $1.2 million to get her admitted as a fake soccer player.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by CompareCards\n\n  * ### 9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt\n\n  * ### Transfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### Fly practically free with these 3 travel cards\n\n  * ### Getting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent credit\n\n## Content by LendingTree\n\n  * ### How to pay off your house ASAP (It\'s so simple)\n\n  * ### Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1,608/mo\n\n  * ### Need cash?

And, at a time of year when colleges\nare whittling down the mountain of applications and sending out acceptance\nletters, they\'re having to look for prospective students who might be\nconnected to the scandal.\n\nFifty people -- including Hollywood stars, top CEOs, college coaches and\nstandardized test administrators -- allegedly took part in the scheme to cheat\non tests and admit students to leading institutions as athletes, regardless of\ntheir abilities. At least eight universities are named in a federal indictment\nand criminal complaint.\n\nCheat. Bribe. Lie. Here\'s how the college admissions scam allegedly worked\n\nWilliam Rick Singer, the plot\'s accused mastermind, allegedly told prospective\nclients that he created a "side door" for wealthy families to get their\nchildren into top US colleges. Singer was paid roughly $25 million by parents\nto help their children get into the schools, the US attorney said.\n\nWhile the names of the students involved have not been released, universities\nare distancing themselves from coaches identified in the scandal and\nscrambling to contain the fallout from a scandal that raises questions about\nwhether qualified students were denied entry to accommodate children of the\nrich and famous.\n\nRead More\n\nThe prosecutor also raised the possibility that students could be charged.\nHere\'s how the universities are responding:\n\n### University of Southern California\n\n **Who:** The University of Southern California is at the epicenter of the\nscandal, with some of the biggest names linked to it, including actress Lori\nLoughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli.\n\n### JUST WATCHED\n\n## What Lori Loughlin\'s daughter said before attending USC\n\nReplay\n\nMore Videos ...\n\n#### MUST WATCH\n\nWhat Lori Loughlin\'s daughter said before attending USC  01:17\n\nUSC said it fired senior associate **** athletic director Donna Heinel and\nwater polo coach Jovan Vavic, who are both charged in the scheme. The school\nhas also placed a faculty member on leave who was named in the indictment as a\nparent.\n\n**Action steps:** The school plans to use any money received in connection\nwith the alleged scheme to fund scholarships for underprivileged students,\nUSC\'s interim President Wanda M. Austin said.\n\nAlso, the university is conducting a review for enrolled students and USC will\nmake informed, appropriate decisions after it\'s completed, university\nspokesman Gary Polakovic said.\n\n**Outcome for students:** All applicants connected to the cheating scam would\nbe denied admission, Polakovic said. The university said it identified six\nstudents in the current admissions cycle who would be denied admission to USC.\n\nUSC suspends class registration for students who might be linked to admissions\nscam\n\nThe school is preventing students who may be associated with the college\nadmissions scandal from registering for classes or acquiring transcripts while\nthe school investigates. The school didn\'t say how many students are impacted\nbut said that those affected have been notified that "their status is under\nreview." The school could revoke admission or expel students after the review.\n\nUSC is not identifying past, present or potential students involved in the\nscheme, citing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 that says\ninformation cannot be released without prior written consent from the student.\n\n### UCLA\n\n **Who:** UCLA has put its men\'s soccer head coach Jorge Salcedo on leave as\nhe faces a charge of conspiracy to commit racketeering.\n\n**Action steps:**UCLA said it\'s reviewing the allegations in the Department of\nJustice\'s filing related to admissions decisions.\n\n**Outcome for students:** UCLA is reviewing one currently enrolled student and\none prospective student, both with possible ties to the college admissions\ninvestigation, according to Tod Tamberg, UCLA spokesman.\n\n"If UCLA discovers that any prospective, admitted or enrolled student has\nmisrepresented any aspect of his/her application, or that information about\nthe applicant has been withheld, UCLA may take a number of disciplinary\nactions, up to and including cancellation of admission," said Tamberg.\n\n### Stanford University\n\nStanford students file class-action lawsuit over college admissions scandal\n\n **Who:** Stanford University fired head sailing coach John Vandemoer, who\npleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy. He allegedly accepted financial\ncontributions to the sailing program in exchange for recommending two\nprospective students for admission to Stanford.\n\n"Neither student came to Stanford; one student was initially denied admission\nand intended to reapply but never did, and the second never completed an\napplication," the university said in a statement.\n\n**Action steps:** Stanford said it has no evidence that the allegations\ninvolved anyone else but said it will conduct an internal review.\n\nThe university said it\'s working to determine the "most appropriate way" to\nredirect the financial contributions -- a total of $770,000 -- made to the\nsailing team by Singer\'s company, The Key Worldwide.\n\nThe CEO behind the college admissions cheating scam wanted to help the\nwealthy. But that\'s not all\n\n **Outcome for student:** Some of the Key\'s funding was associated with a\nthird student, who was not named in the government\'s charges, the university\nsaid. The student hadn\'t received a recommendation from Vandemoer, but is\nenrolled at Stanford.\n\n"The student has no affiliation with the sailing program," the university\nstated. "We are working to better understand the circumstances around this\nstudent and will take whatever actions are appropriate based on what we\nlearn."\n\n### Georgetown University\n\n**Who:** Georgetown University\'s former tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, is charged\nin the scheme. The university said he has not coached the tennis team since\nDecember 2017 after an internal investigation.\n\n"The investigation found that Mr. Ernst had violated University rules\nconcerning admissions, and he separated from the University in 2018. The\nUniversity was not aware of any alleged criminal activity or acceptance of\nbribes by Mr. Ernst until it was later contacted by the US Attorney\'s Office,"\nthe university said in a statement.\n\nWhat we know so far in the college admissions cheating scandal\n\nThe school said it\'s cooperating with investigators. University spokesman Matt\nHill said there\'s no indication any other Georgetown employees were involved.\n\nCNN has reached out to Ernst, who now coaches at the University of Rhode\nIsland. The school placed him on administrative leave and said he\'s not\ninvolved in recruiting current players or signing new ones.\n\n **Action steps:**The university says it established a new policy in 2018 to\nstrengthen the recruitment and admissions process, including audits of its\nathletics department "to determine whether any recruited students are not on\nthe roster of the sport for which they were recruited."\n\nAn independent, third party is to conduct an audit of its athletic recruiting\n"to strengthen the integrity of our process," the school said.\n\n **Outcome for students:** "The indictment indicated 12 students who attended\nor are attending Georgetown," Hill told CNN. "We are reviewing the details of\nthe indictment and examining our records to confirm this number."\n\nHe declined to comment on the students involved, citing the Family Educational\nRights and Privacy Act.\n\n### Yale University\n\n**Who:** The former head coach of Yale University\'s women\'s soccer team\nconspired with Singer to accept bribes in exchange for designating Yale\napplicants as recruits for the team, according to a court filing. Rudolph\n"Rudy" Meredith was the head coach for more than 20 years. In 2015, he agreed\nto work with Singer, according to the filing.\n\nEx-Yale Law admissions dean: These are the victims of cheating scandal I worry\nabout\n\nA spokesman for Yale said the university is a "victim of a crime perpetrated\nby its former women\'s soccer coach."\n\n**Action steps:** The school will conduct an investigation to determine\nwhether "others have been involved in activities that have corrupted the\nathletic recruitment and admissions process," President Peter Salovey said in\na letter to the college community.\n\nYale will use external advisers who will suggest changes that will help the\ncollege "detect and prevent efforts to defraud the admission process," he\nadded. Officials are working to implement a code of conduct for athletic\nrecruitment, he said.\n\nThere will be no delay in the admissions decisions, Yale University spokesman\nTom Conroy told CNN.\n\n **Outcome for student:** One student was admitted to Yale with a false\nathletic endorsement, according to Salovey\'s letter.\n\n"Although I do not comment on specific disciplinary actions taken with respect\nto an individual student, our longstanding policy is to rescind the admission\nof students who falsified their Yale College applications," Salovey wrote.\n\nOn March 25, Conroy said Yale has rescinded the admission of one student in\nrelation to the scam.\n\n### Wake Forest University\n\n **Who:** The university in Winston-Salem, North Carolina put volleyball head\ncoach Bill Ferguson on leave after he was charged with conspiracy to commit\nracketeering.\n\nAdmissions scandal reveals \'aristocracy masquerading as a meritocracy\'\n\n"The indictment alleges Ferguson accepted financial payments to influence the\nadmission of a student that had previously been placed on the waitlist," Wake\nForest President Nathan Hatch wrote in an email to students and staff.\n\nHatch said the university is reviewing admissions and athletics practices, but\nso far it appears Ferguson acted independently and was the only person\ninvolved with the alleged misconduct.\n\nSinger directed $100,000 from one of his charitable accounts to Ferguson\nincluding a $10,000 check to the Wake Forest Deacon Club, a $40,000 check to\nWake Forest Women\'s Volleyball, and a $50,000 check to a private volleyball\ncamp Ferguson controlled.\n\nIn exchange, prosecutors allege Ferguson agreed to designate the daughter of\none of Singer\'s client -- who had previously applied to and been placed on the\nwait list at Wake Forest -- as a recruit for the women\'s volleyball team to\nhelp her get admitted.\n\n **Action steps:** Hatch announced that the $50,000 the school received from\nSinger\'s foundation would go to a scholarship program to support first-\ngeneration college students. He also said that the director of athletics and\ndean of admissions were directed to review the admission process.\n\n **Outcome for student:** Wake Forest doesn\'t plan at this time to take action\nagainst the one currently enrolled student mentioned in the college admissions\nscandal indictment, a spokesperson said on March 20, adding that there is no\nevidence the student knew of the alleged financial transaction.\n\n### University of Texas at Austin\n\n **Who:** The University of Texas at Austin dismissed its men\'s tennis coach,\nMichael Center, a day after placing him on leave. Center is charged with\nconspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.\n\nWhat the college cheating scandal says about race\n\nCenter is accused of taking nearly $100,000 in bribes to get an applicant, who\ndidn\'t play competitive tennis, admitted as a tennis player. The student quit\nthe team after enrolling in the school, the university said.\n\n"This appears to have been a singular event involving one UT employee who has\nsince been terminated," the university said.\n\n **Action steps:** President Gregory L. Fenves said he has asked the vice\npresident for legal affairs to conduct a review of Center\'s alleged 2015 fraud\nand determine whether the university has the necessary rules and procedures in\nplace to prevent future violations. He said this will include a review of the\nadmissions processes for student athletes.\n\n**Outcome for student:** UT didn\'t comment on the student citing the federal\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act.\n\n"If a student is alleged to have included fraudulent information in an\nadmissions application, a careful review is conducted to determine whether\nthat occurred," it stated.\n\n### University of San Diego\n\n **Who:** The school identified Lamont Smith and two applicants as the only\nthree USD employees, students or applicants involved in the alleged\nwrongdoing. The university says of the two applicants, only one is a current\nstudent and one declined admission.\n\nSmith had been the University of San Diego men\'s head basketball coach and\nleft the university in March 2018, according to a letter sent by the\nuniversity president, James T. Harris.\n\nSmith became assistant basketball coach for the University of Texas at El Paso\nand resigned from that position on March 20 after being identified in the\ncollege admissions scandal.\n\n **Action steps:** The school said it will work with an outside law firm to\nconduct an investigation and appoint a special committee to provide oversight\ninto the university\'s response.\n\n**Outcome for student:** "As with any students, falsifying or making\nmisrepresentations on an application for admission can be grounds for\ndisciplinary action under USD\'s Student Code of Rights and Responsibilities,"\nthe university president\'s letter stated.\n\nCNN\'s Kristina Sgeueglia, Stephanie Becker, Rob Frehse, Carma Hassan, Augusta\nAnthony, Madeline Holcombe, Eric Levenson, Mark Morales, Evan Simko-Bednarski\nand Traci Tamura contributed to this report.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by CompareCards\n\n  * ### 9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt\n\n  * ### Transfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### Fly practically free with these 3 travel cards\n\n  * ### Getting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent credit\n\n## Content by LendingTree\n\n  * ### How to pay off your house ASAP (It\'s so simple)\n\n  * ### Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1,608/mo\n\n  * ### Need cash?

There were also several credit\ncards in her name.\n\nRead More\n\nZhang arrived in Newark on a flight from Shanghai on March 28, Garcia said.\nThe incident occurred on March 30.\n\nZhang was discovered to have a thumb drive with malware, as well as a laptop,\nan external hard drive and four cell phones. She was charged with two counts\n-- making false statements to federal authorities and a misdemeanor offense of\nentering a restricted area without authorization.\n\nTrump is removing US Secret Service director\n\nShe has not been charged with any offenses that nod to international spying.\nHowever, the FBI has been investigating the Zhang incident as part of a\nChinese espionage effort.\n\nIn the first hour of the hearing, Zhang\'s defense attorney has attempted to\npoke holes in several procedural steps the Secret Service took during its\nadmission of Zhang to Mar-a-Lago, in determining whether she was lying and in\nquestioning her that afternoon and night.\n\nThe agent who questioned her, Samuel Ivanovich, has testified for about an\nhour about what happened that day. The attorney Robert Adler, a public\ndefender, has so far had Ivanovich admit that a Secret Service agent who spoke\nMandarin was called in to help with translations hours into Zhang\'s\nquestioning, and that the agency that protects the President largely relied on\nMar-a-Lago staff to determine whether to admit her, didn\'t see red flags in\nthe devices she carried, and asked no further questions of Zhang once they\nbelieved she was related to another club member with the same last name --\nwhich is extremely common in China.\n\nThe Secret Service has no audio security recordings of its interactions with\nher and what she said on the grounds of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIvanovich, being questioned about the malware allegedly found on Zhang\'s thumb\ndrive, said the agent examining the drive found "a file" that began to install\nonto an agent\'s computer, and the agent looking at it said that had never\nhappened before, and it was "very out of the ordinary" when conducting a\ncriminal analysis.\n\nThe agent looking at the drive had to stop the analysis and shut down his\ncomputer.\n\n### Mar-a-Lago security\n\nTrump has described the Zhang case as a "fluke situation," but the case so far\nhas highlighted the possibility of security flaws Trump\'s private club.\n\nRELATED: Trump is removing US Secret Service director\n\nZhang talked her way into the club, carrying a large number of electronic\ndevices including malware on a thumbdrive. At first, she told a special agent\nat Mar-a-Lago she wanted to visit the pool at the beach club. The Mar-a-Lago\nbeach club manager then noted her last name matched that of a club member, and\nthe club waved her in, believing her to be the club member\'s daughter, and\n"due to a potential language barrier issue," authorities wrote in her criminal\ncomplaint.\n\nA golf cart shuttle driver then took her to the club\'s main reception area,\nwhere Zhang claimed she was to attend a "United Nations Chinese American\nAssociation" event, and then told a Secret Service agent a "United Nations\nFriendship Event" on the premises -- neither of which existed.\n\nLater, Zhang told authorities who were questioning her that her Chinese friend\n"Charles" had sent her from Shanghai to speak with the President\'s family\nabout Chinese and American foreign economic relations, according to the\ncomplaint\n\nThe case comes as Democrats in Congress press for more information about\nsecurity at Mar-a-Lago and, separately, for an FBI investigation into Florida\nbusinesswoman Li "Cindy" Yang\'s efforts to interact with Trump, after she\nappeared to have pitched to Chinese clients the opportunity to interact with\nthe President and spent time at Mar-a-Lago and with the President at a Super\nBowl party.\n\n### Previous hearing\n\nZhang\'s previous hearing when she was first arrested went unusually\xe2\x80\x94she\nadmitted to owning a BMW and a home in China worth more than 1 million\nAmerican dollars, and asked extensively about how she may get in contact with\nan attorney or find phone numbers of contacts in America if she were detained\nin a Florida jail.\n\nShe said she worked as an investor and consultant who sought to develop\nbusiness contacts in the US, but kept some money in a Wells Fargo account\nhere.\n\nShe has been in jail since her arrest, with a court-appointed public defender\nrepresenting her.\n\nThe federal magistrate judge, William Matthewman, even noted the astuteness of\nher questions and her intelligence at the previous hearing. There\'s been some\ndispute over how well Zhang speaks and understands English, though the court\ndid provide her with a language interpreter at the previous court hearing.\n\n_This story is breaking and will be updated._\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by CompareCards\n\n  * ###  9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt\n\n  * ### Transfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### Fly practically free with these 3 travel cards\n\n  * ### Getting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent credit\n\n## Content by LendingTree\n\n  * ### How to pay off your house ASAP (It\'s so simple)\n\n  * ### Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1,608/mo\n\n  * ### Need cash?

Cory Booker announced Monday he will take the lead in the Senate on\na proposal that would establish a commission to study possible reparations, an\nidea that has emerged as a key policy question in the 2020 Democratic\npresidential primary and won broad support from the candidates.\n\nSuch a commission would seek to remedy generations-worth of discrimination as\na result of "overt policies fueled by white supremacy and racism that have\noppressed African-Americans economically for generations," the New Jersey\nDemocrat said in a statement, in addition to policies "that have ushered\nmillions of Americans into the middle class" but "systematically excluded\nblacks."\n\n"This bill is a way of addressing head-on the persistence of racism, white\nsupremacy and implicit racial bias in our country," Booker added. "It will\nbring together the best minds to study the issue and propose solutions that\nwill finally begin to right the economic scales of past harms and make sure we\nare a country where all dignity and humanity is affirmed."\n\n2020 Democrats vow to sign House reparations study bill\n\nThe bill, originally introduced by former Rep. John Conyers of Michigan and\ncurrently sponsored in the House by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, has\nemerged as a key issue for 2020 Democrats -- and an area of consensus. At the\nNational Action Network Conference in New York last week, Rev. Al Sharpton\nquestioned one presidential hopeful after another on the measure and the\ncandidates vouched their support.\n\nNow, Booker seems poised to emerge as the legislative leader on the issue.\n\nRead More\n\nThe New Jersey senator has previously vented frustration that the question of\nreparations has been "reduced to a box to check on a presidential list, when\nthis is so much more of a serious conversation," as he told CNN\'s Don Lemon\nduring a recent town hall in Orangeburg, South Carolina.\n\n"Do I support legislation that is race-conscious about balancing the economic\nscales?" Booker said. "Not only do I support it, but I have legislation that\nactually does it."\n\nOn the campaign trail, Booker has promoted a "baby bonds" proposal that would\ngive each child a savings account, with money added annually based on a\nfamily\'s wealth -- touting a Columbia University study that concluded such a\nprogram would "dramatically reduce racial wealth inequality."\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by CompareCards\n\n  * ### 9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt\n\n  * ### Transfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### Fly practically free with these 3 travel cards\n\n  * ### Getting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent credit\n\n## Content by LendingTree\n\n  * ### How to pay off your house ASAP (It\'s so simple)\n\n  * ### Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1,608/mo\n\n  * ### Need cash?

Stephen Tusa Jr. downgraded GE (GE) to "underweight" on Monday and\npredicted the stock will nearly get cut in half to $5 by the end of the year.\n\nIn a withering, 123-page research report, the influential JPMorgan (JPM)\nanalyst argued the "risk/reward" for owning GE has "tilted back negative"\nbecause the stock\'s 2019 spike hasn\'t been based on underlying change.\n\n"We believe many investors are underestimating the severity of the challenges\nand underlying risks at GE," Tusa wrote to clients, "while overestimating the\nvalue of small positives."\n\nGE\'s stock plunged 8% to $9.15 on the downgrade, making it the biggest loser\nin the S&P 500. The maker of light bulbs and jet engines is in jeopardy of\nsuffering its worst day since last fall. GE was up 38% on the year as of\nFriday\'s close.\n\nRead More\n\nTusa\'s GE calls are powerful because he presciently went negative on the\niconic company in May 2016, when the stock was trading at $30. GE would\neventually lose three-quarters of its value because of a cash crisis sparked\nby mounting debt and poorly timed acquisitions. The company even got kicked\nout of the exclusive 30-stock Dow.\n\nThe JPMorgan analyst upgraded GE to "neutral" in December and spelled out a\npath for reviving the company. Even though Tusa voiced skepticism in that\nresearch report, his upgrade helped send the stock skyrocketing.\n\n### Nightmare recession scenario\n\nWhile Wall Street is betting the GE crisis is over, Tusa is urging extreme\ncaution. He pointed to GE\'s "stubbornly heavy debt," GE Power\'s "weak"\nresults, the need to pump GE Capital with more cash and overexuberance about\nthe health of the aviation division.\n\nThe nightmare scenario is that the next recession arrives before GE has\nrepaired its debt-riddled balance sheet.\n\nGE would be "vulnerable to liquidity issues in the event of a recession," Tusa\nsaid.\n\nGE bets on offshore wind as fossil fuels business stumbles\n\nAn economic downturn wouldn\'t just prolong GE\'s turnaround plan. The ensuing\nmarket turmoil would add stress to GE\'s pension program, which is already\nfacing a massive shortfall. A decline in asset values, along with rate cuts\nfrom the Federal Reserve, would increase GE\'s pension liabilities by more than\n$30 billion, JPMorgan estimates.\n\nGE\'s stock could plummet "substantially lower" than $5 if the company doesn\'t\nraise more cash and there is a recession, he said.\n\nOther analysts have expressed confidence in GE\'s turnaround under Larry Culp,\nwho has moved with a sense of urgency since becoming CEO last fall.\n\nLast month, RBC analyst Deane Dray raised his price target on GE to $13 and\nkept an "outperform" rating on the stock.\n\n"There is still much to fix at GE, but the market can now have confidence in\nthe senior leader at the helm," Dray wrote in a report to clients.\n\n### \'Where is all the money going?\'\n\nEven though investors turned uber-bullish on GE this year, the company\'s\nmanagement team has preached caution.\n\nCulp recently warned that 2019 will be another brutal year, marked by up to $2\nbillion of negative free cash flow from its industrial businesses. That would\nbe a sharp reversal from the $4.3 billion generated in 2018.\n\n"GE\'s challenges in 2019 are complex but clear," Culp said in a statement last\nmonth. "We are facing them head on as we execute our strategic priorities to\nimprove our financial position."\n\nGE warns of bleak 2019 but promises a brighter future\n\nJohn Inch, an analyst at Gordon Haskett, predicted Monday that GE could likely\nlose about $2.5 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter. Anything\nworse than that would raise concern about GE\'s financial health.\n\n"Both the bond markets and ratings agencies would not be pleased," Inch wrote\nin a report.\n\nInch expressed dismay over GE\'s worsening debt ratios in the face of efforts\nto raise cash by selling long-held businesses.\n\n"Where is all the money going?" Inch asked. "The company appears to be\napproaching the end of the runway of obvious assets it could sell."\n\n### GE gave EU officials \'incorrect information\'\n\nMeanwhile, GE landed in hot water with regulators for a recent renewable\nenergy acquisition.\n\nThe European Commission on Monday fined GE 52 million euros ($59 million) for\nproviding authorities "incorrect information" about its 2017 takeover of LM\nWind.\n\nRegulators said GE initially said it was not developing any high-power\noffshore wind turbines beyond its existing 6 megawatt turbine. The commission\nlater discovered from an unnamed "third party" that GE was "simultaneously"\noffering a 12 megawatt offshore wind turbine to potential customers. GE\ncorrected the error a few weeks later and regulators later approved the $1.7\nbillion LM Wind acquisition.\n\nGE said in a statement that it is reviewing the European Commission decision\nbefore determining its next steps.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by SmartAsset\n\n  * ### These are your 3 financial advisors near you\n\n  * ### This site finds and compares 3 financial advisors in your area\n\n  * ### Check this off your list before retirement: talk to an advisor\n\n  * ### Answer these questions to find the right financial advisor for you\n\n  * ### Find CFPs in your area in 5 minutes\n\n  * \n\n  1.

In early January, three Russian naval ships docked in the\nPhilippine capital for what was described as a visit to "further enhance and\nsustain the promotion of peace, stability and maritime cooperation."\n\nThe most recent arrival comes just months before the two countries are due to\nsign a naval cooperation agreement, likely in July, which will reportedly\ninvolve more joint training exercises and reciprocal port visits.\n\nRussia and China have also been moving closer together in recent years,\nconducting joint military drills and signing economic deals, with both sides\nclaiming relations are at their "best level in history."\n\nRead More\n\nMonday\'s Russia visit also comes amid the annual Balikatan joint exercises\nbetween the Philippines and US, which finish April 12.\n\nThe Balikatan drills feature more than 7,500 troops, F-35B stealth fighters\nand include live-fire training and amphibious operations among other events.\n\nPhilippines\' President Rodrigo Duterte (4th L) shake hands with Russia\'s Rear\nAdmiral Eduard Mikhailov (3rd L) onboard the Russian anti-submarine navy ship\nAdmiral Tributs in Manila on January 6, 2017.\n\nWhile the Russian ship visit is not to that scale, Moscow\'s growing ties with\nthe Philippines and presence in the region come at a time of increased\ntensions in the South China Sea.\n\nThe Philippines government said hundreds of Chinese vessels, including some\nmilitary ships, had been spotted around Thitu Island in the Spratly chain,\nwhich is controlled by Manila but claimed by Beijing.\n\nDuterte threatens \'suicide mission\' if Beijing oversteps in South China Sea\n\nThe Chinese flotilla began appearing around Thitu in December and January,\nabout the time Manila began construction on the contested maritime feature.\n\nIn a speech Thursday, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte warned Beijing to\nleave Thitu Island alone, threatening military action in response to any\nChinese aggression.\n\n"Let us be friends, but do not touch Pagasa Island and the rest," Duterte\nsaid, according to CNN Philippines, using the Philippine word Pagasa for\nThitu. "If you make moves there, that\'s a different story. I will tell my\nsoldiers, \'Prepare for suicide mission\'."\n\n### JUST WATCHED\n\n## Why it\'s so tense in the South China Sea\n\nReplay\n\nMore Videos ...\n\n#### MUST WATCH\n\nWhy it\'s so tense in the South China Sea 01:17\n\nChina and the Philippines are just two of the many countries who lay claim to\nlarge portions of the South China Sea, along with Vietnam, Malaysia and\nBrunei. In a bid to reinforce their claim on the territory, China has built\nand militarized artificial islands across the important shipping lane.\n\nTensions cooled after Duterte pursued a closer economic relationship with\nBeijing. Manila also turned to Moscow for support, with Duterte shifting his\ncountry\'s previously close ties to Washington.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by CompareCards\n\n  * ### 9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt\n\n  * ### Transfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### Fly practically free with these 3 travel cards\n\n  * ### Getting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent credit\n\n## Content by LendingTree\n\n  * ### How to pay off your house ASAP (It\'s so simple)\n\n  * ### Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1,608/mo\n\n  * ### Need cash?

"Sadly, Ryan is sick, and I look most\nlike him so they asked me to fill his shoes tonight. Ryan, love you, buddy.\nHope you get better."\n\nIt\'s unclear what Seacrest was sick with at the time, but the episode was\ntaped a few weeks ago.\n\nRead More\n\nBones revealed on Twitter that in exchange for stepping in, Seacrest sent him\na pair of sneakers with a cheeky card that read, "Thanks for filling in my\nshoes for me on \'American Idol.\'"\n\nSeacrest has been the host of "American Idol" since the show debuted in 2002.\nHe is also the co-host of "Live with Kelly and Ryan" and hosts a daily morning\nradio show, "On Air With Ryan Seacrest." He also produces several series for\nE! and serves as the executive producer and co-host of ABC\'s, "Dick Clark\'s\nNew Year\'s Rockin\' Eve."\n\nFair to say Seacrest earned a night off.\n\n_This story has been corrected to reflect Bones\' professional background as a\nradio host and author.

It did not include responses from those identifying as\nLGBTQ or asexual, and it assumed that all married couples had had sex.\n\nThe researchers based their nationwide estimate on data from seven national\nfertility surveys conducted over three decades. Each drew on the responses of\nbetween 11,553 and 17,859 adults 18 to 39 years old.\n\n### \'Money talks\'\n\nThe report found that a higher percentage of men on lower incomes remained\nsexually inexperienced compared to women.\n\n"Although the discussion around cause and effect becomes very complex when\nconsidering who becomes sexually experienced and who remains a virgin, we show\nthat heterosexual inexperience is at least partly a socioeconomic issue for\nmen. Simply put, money talks," said Cyrus Ghaznavi, the lead author of the\nstudy.\n\nThe issue of birth rate is important in Japan because its population is aging\nrapidly.\n\nJapan is considered a "super-aged" nation, meaning more than 20% of its\npopulation is over 65 years old. Just 946,060 babies were born in 2017, a\nrecord low since official records began in 1899.\n\nThe decline means a shrinking cohort of workers is left supporting an\nincreasingly elderly population in need of health care and pensions, explained\nKukhee Choo, a media studies professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, who\nwasn\'t involved in the research. Choo added that putting a spotlight on the\nrise of sexlessness is part of a domestic agenda to rectify the population\ndecline.\n\nIn recent years, local governments have boosted their efforts to pair off\nheterosexual singles in a bid to reverse the country\'s declining fertility\nrate.\n\n"There seems to be a national push to get people to really think about this\nissue and feel a sense of urgency," Choo said.\n\nFurthermore, despite Japan\'s multibillion-dollar porn industry, Choo said\ndiscussions around porn and sex remain taboo. "Sex is seen as dirty and\ncorrupting in Japan," Choo said.\n\n"My students can\'t use the word \'penis\' or \'vagina,\' and if a woman expresses\nany knowledge or interest in sex, you\'re seen as a fallen women. Men don\'t\ntalk about it, either."\n\n### Economy link\n\nConservative attitudes around sex haven\'t always been the norm in Japan,\naccording to Choo. Many Japanese embraced Western notions of free love and\nsexual liberation after Japan\'s defeat in World War II in 1945 and the\nintroduction of US values, said Choo.\n\nAs Japan underwent an "economic miracle" from the late 1940s to the the late\n\'80s, during which it became the world\'s second-largest economy after the\nUnited States, Japan\'s male white-collar workers increased.\n\nThough they were expected to work long hours, corporations rewarded them with\nstable middle-class lifestyles and lifetime employment. Such men became the\ndominant idea of masculinity.\n\nDuring those decades, companies in cities and densely populated towns became\nthe breeding ground for new romances as they looked favorably upon marriages\nbetween staff.\n\n"They\'d actively hire people who they thought would be a good match for one\nanother and organize sports days and company holidays to facilitate matches\nbetween people," said Shigeru Kashima, a Japanese studies professor at Meiji\nUniversity.\n\nWho is having more sex over age 50, research explores\n\nBut by the \'90s, Japan\'s economic boom went bust, resulting in a long period\nof financial insecurity and economic stagnation that came to be known as the\n"lost decade."\n\nKashima argues that men\'s loss of economic clout following the country\'s\nperiod of financial stagnation affected their confidence when it came to\npursuing women.\n\n"Over the past two decades, some Japanese men have found it hard to face\nexternal hardships and fear rejection," Kashima said. "There\'s also an\nattitude of men devoting themselves more to their hobbies compared to women\ndedicating themselves to work."\n\n### Redefining virginity and sex\n\nChoo said that while some Japanese heterosexuals may be inexperienced\nsexually, relationships mean different things to different people.\n\n"Some people are in a relationship and they\'re sexless. Some people don\'t want\nto be in a relationship because they don\'t want to be sexual.\xc2\xa0This is all\ngoing on at the same time among young people in Japan," Choo said.\n\nThe real reason people rent middle-aged men in Japan\n\nUeda, the co-author of the study, said the heterosexual virgins surveyed in\nthe report expressed an interest in marrying later on in life, suggesting that\ntheir sexual inexperience wasn\'t by choice.\n\nAnd while the reasons behind rising heterosexual virginity rates are complex,\nvirtual sex and porn consumption have also been blamed for the decline of\nheterosexual relations in Japan.\n\n"You could say that there is a demand for alternative sexual or romantic\nexperiences because people are finding it difficult to find partners, or you\ncould hypothesize that the rise in these services are because some people\nprefer to express their sexuality in these ways," Ueda said.\n\nGet CNN Health\'s weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get **The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta** every Tuesday\nfrom the CNN Health team.\n\nUeda\'s team also suggested that Japan could be leading a global trend toward\nsexual inexperience between heterosexual couples, with sexual inactivity\nrising among young adults in Germany and the United States, suggesting a\nglobal shift in attitudes on sex.\n\nKatie Hunt contributed to this report.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by CompareCards\n\n  * ### 9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt\n\n  * ### Transfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### Fly practically free with these 3 travel cards\n\n  * ### Getting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent credit\n\n## Content by LendingTree\n\n  * ### How to pay off your house ASAP (It\'s so simple)\n\n  * ### Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1,608/mo\n\n  * ### Need cash?

But even\nby python standards, this one was colossal.\n\nScientists caught a female python in the Florida Everglades that was more than\n17 feet long, weighed 140 pounds and contained 73 developing eggs.\n\nThe snake is the largest python ever removed from Big Cypress National\nPreserve, a 729,000-acre expanse of swampland west of Miami in South Florida,\naccording to a statement Friday on the preserve\'s Facebook page.\n\nThe picture with the Facebook post tells it all.\n\nIt shows a team of four researchers, standing apart from one another, holding\nup the gigantic reptile.\n\nRead More\n\nWhile pythons of all sizes have been found in the Everglades, most of them are\nbetween 6 and 10 feet long. The largest one was over 18 feet long and weighed\nmore than 100 pounds, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation\nCommission.\n\nStill, this latest find is impressive. Big Cypress\' rangers credit research\nand new tracking technology with making it possible.\n\n"Using male pythons with radio transmitters allows the team to track the male\nto locate breeding females," their statement says. "The team not only removes\nthe invasive snakes, but collects data for research, develops new removal\ntools and learns how the pythons are using the Preserve."\n\nThe Burmese python is native to Southeast Asia, but in recent decades the big\nsnakes have become a slithering menace in Florida. The Everglades is a vast\narea with a tropical climate perfect for pythons to hide and thrive.\n\nState wildlife officials estimate there are as many as 100,000 pythons living\nin the vast swamps outside Miami. The snakes pose significant threats to\nnative wildlife.\n\nTo control their population, Florida even holds competitions encouraging\nhunters to remove as many of them as possible.\n\nConservationists in Florida sometimes use radio telemetry to track Burmese\npythons.\n\nSome 1,600 people registered for the inaugural Python Challenge in 2013,\norganized by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

We\'ve just been spoiled.\n\nNew York (CNN Business)Warren Buffett, Wells Fargo\'s largest and most powerful\nshareholder, doesn\'t want the troubled bank to hire a CEO from Wall Street.\n\nRecruiting a Wall Street executive is "automatically going to draw the ire of\na significant percentage" of the US Senate and House of Representatives,\nBuffett told the Financial Times in an interview that published on Sunday.\n"And that\'s just not smart."\n\nThe comments from Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) owns nearly 10% of\nWells Fargo, underline the deep political and reputational troubles at one of\nAmerica\'s largest banks. Tim Sloan stepped down abruptly as CEO late last\nmonth after failing to stop the bank\'s two-and-a-half-year crisis.\n\nWells Fargo (WFC) pledged to find an outsider to replace Sloan, a three-decade\nveteran of the bank who despite efforts to fix the bank was stained by its\ncultural problems.\n\n"They just have to come from someplace [outside Wells] and they shouldn\'t come\nfrom Wall Street," Buffett told the FT. "They probably shouldn\'t come from\nJPMorgan or Goldman Sachs."\n\nRead More\n\nThat would exclude several individuals who have emerged in press reports or\nanalyst chatter as replacements for Sloan.\n\nFor instance, former Goldman Sachs (GS) execs Gary Cohn and Harvey Schwartz\nhave been linked in media reports to the Wells Fargo job. Both have denied\ninterest.\n\nAnd analysts have floated the possibility of Marianne Lake, the well-respected\nCFO of JPMorgan (JPM), as a replacement for Sloan. Lake would be the first\nwoman to lead one of the big US banks.\n\nWells Fargo\'s CEO is out. Here\'s how the bank can end its crisis\n\nBuffett\'s comments do not rule out the possibility that San Francisco-based\nWells Fargo could turn to another rumored name: Richard Davis, the former CEO\nof US Bancorp (USB). Davis doesn\'t come from Wall Street and he\'s even got\nroots in California.\n\nWells Fargo declined to comment.\n\nBuffett continues to express optimism in Wells Fargo\'s underlying business\ndespite the harm done by the fake-accounts scandal that erupted in September\n2016.\n\n"If you look at Wells, through this whole thing they\'re uncovering a whole lot\nof problems, but they aren\'t losing any customers to speak of," said Buffett,\nwhose firm at the end of 2018 owned more than 400 million Wells Fargo shares\ncurrently worth about $21 billion.\n\nBut Wells Fargo\'s business has been hurt by rising legal fees, a tarnished\nreputation and tough sanctions from federal regulators.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by SmartAsset\n\n  * ### These are your 3 financial advisors near you\n\n  * ### This site finds and compares 3 financial advisors in your area\n\n  * ### Check this off your list before retirement: talk to an advisor\n\n  * ### Answer these questions to find the right financial advisor for you\n\n  * ### Find CFPs in your area in 5 minutes\n\n  * \n\n  1.

We urge you to tender your resignation, effective immediately," the\ntwo-sentence letter read.\n\nIn a statement, council member Brandon Scott, who tweeted a photo of the\nletter Monday, noted the "severity of the action (the council members) have\ntaken," but said Baltimore was deserving of a mayor who can focus on other\nissues affecting the city.\n\n> Please see letter from my colleagues and I to @MayorPugh50. We strongly\nbelieve that for the sake of Baltimore @MayorPugh50 should resign from office.\npic.twitter.com/1oaZZkmh38\n\n>\n\n> \xe2\x80\x94 Brandon M. Scott (@CouncilmanBMS) April 8, 2019\n\nThe letter was signed by 14 members of the 15-member council -- the only\nmember not to sign it was Bernard C. "Jack" Young, the council\'s president who\nhas been serving as the "ex officio Mayor of Baltimore City" since Pugh took a\nleave of absence last week.\n\nDespite the calls for her to step down, Pugh does not plan on vacating her\npost, according to her spokesman, James Bentley. In a statement issued Monday,\nBentley said Pugh, whose current term expires in 2020, "fully intends to\nresume the duties of her office and continuing her work on behalf of the\npeople and the City of Baltimore."\n\nRead More\n\nPugh\'s leave of absence -- which Bentley attributed to a bout of pneumonia --\ncame the same day Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan wrote to the Office of\nthe State Prosecutor and requested an investigation into the sales of\nthousands of Pugh\'s book, "Healthy Holly," to the University of Maryland\nMedical System while she was a member of its board.\n\nUMMS spent $500,000 to fund the purchase of some 100,000 books from Pugh\'s\ncompany Healthy Holly LLC, confirmed UMMS spokesman Michael Schwartzberg, who\nexplained that UMMS never had possession of any Healthy Holly books, nor did\nit distribute books. Book distribution was managed by Healthy Holly LLC.\n\nPugh -- who apologized in March for doing something "to upset the people" --\nrecently returned $100,000 to the medical system and canceled her book deal.\nShe has also resigned from the hospital\'s board, according to Schwartzberg.\n\nPugh also received about $114,000 from Kaiser Permanente for some 20,000 books\nfrom 2015 to 2018, according to the health care provider. Kaiser Permanente\nsaid it delivered the books to back-to-school fairs, elementary schools,\ncommunities of faith and early childhood education and care centers.\n\nAdditionally, Associated Black Charities, a public foundation that works to\nencourage healthier and more prosperous communities, said it spent\napproximately $80,000 between 2011 and 2016 to buy some 10,000 copies of\nPugh\'s books -- a project the organization learned about while she was still a\nstate senator.\n\nCNN\'s Athena Jones and Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by CompareCards\n\n  * ### 9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt\n\n  * ### Transfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### Fly practically free with these 3 travel cards\n\n  * ### Getting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent credit\n\n## Content by LendingTree\n\n  * ### How to pay off your house ASAP (It\'s so simple)\n\n  * ### Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1,608/mo\n\n  * ### Need cash?

At the\ntime, the FDA was considering a proposal to allow the drug to be available\nover-the-counter.\n\nHasselbeck calls the move a "slippery slope to just eliminating life."\n\nThe heated conversation is halted when Walters, who retired as a full-time co-\nhost in 2014, calls for peace.\n\nRead More\n\n"We have to go on and we have to learn how to discuss these things in some\nsort of rational way," she says.\n\nIn the new clip, Hasselbeck, who rips up her notecards before the commercial\nbreak, can be heard using profanities and complaining to fellow co-host Joy\nBehar.\n\n"I\'m not going to sit there and get reprimanded on the air," she says. "What\nthe f---...this woman is driving me nuts"\n\nHasselbeck then bolts and declares she\'s leaving the show.\n\nExecutive producer Bill Geddie gets Hasselbeck to return, telling her "You are\na professional. You\'ve got to go back out there."\n\nHasselbeck returns to her seat with seconds to spare.\n\nOn Friday, Hasselbeck responded to the tape\'s release with a long Instagram\npost.\n\n"Yes-There were times when I was quite humanly reactive. I used a bad word\nwhen frustrated," she wrote in part. "I was pregnant with Taylor and a big\nconversation about the value and the lives of the unborn took place at the\nView... I still hold all my Constitutionally protected rights to freedom of\nfaith : but now: I can hold the hand of the person who does not agree at the\nsame time."\n\nHasselbeck joined "Fox & Friends" after exiting "The View." She left Fox in\n2015.\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the availability of\nthe Plan B One-Step emergency contraception pill without a prescription for\nwomen 15 and older.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by CompareCards\n\n  * ### 9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt\n\n  * ### Transfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### Fly practically free with these 3 travel cards\n\n  * ### Getting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent credit\n\n## Content by LendingTree\n\n  * ### How to pay off your house ASAP (It\'s so simple)\n\n  * ### Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1,608/mo\n\n  * ### Need cash?

Kelly has given his first performance since getting out of jail and\nreportedly it was brief.\n\nAccording to CNN affiliates WICS and WRSP, the singer made an appearance at\nDirty South Lounge in Springfield, Illinois, early Sunday morning.\n\nKelly reportedly arrived around 1:30 a.m. where he spent a little over half an\nhour taking selfies, chatting, dancing and smoking cigars with those who had\ngathered to see him.\n\nHe then grabbed a microphone, thanked his supporters and sang 28 seconds of\none of his songs before the venue closed at 3 a.m., WICS and WRSP reported.\n\nThe fee had been $100 for the event, but that was reduced to $50 after Kelly\narrived, it was reported.\n\nRead More\n\nHours before he was set to appear Kelly announced the event on his official\nInstagram account and appealed to the media.\n\n> View this post on Instagram\n\n>\n\n> A post shared by R Kelly (@rkelly) on Apr 6, 2019 at 4:32pm PDT\n\n"I want the media to take it easy on me man," Kelly said in the video. "This\nis how I got to get paid right now, for right now."\n\nThe singer was released on bail last month for in case in which authorities\nhave said he failed to pay his ex-wife child support of $161,000.\n\nKelly also faces 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse \\-- a Class 2\nfelony -- involving four alleged victims.\n\nKelly has vehemently denied any allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nLast month his legal team filed a request asking the court to grant Kelly\npermission to travel to Dubai to perform shows as they argued he needs to work\nto pay child support and other bills.\n\nThat request was later put on hold by Kelly\'s attorneys.\n\nKelly\'s attorney, Steve Greenberg, told CNN in a statement about his Dirty\nSouth Lounge appearance that "Months ago a show was scheduled in Springfield,\nand this was the "aftershow" party."\n\n"Although the show was canceled the nightclub asked him to still appear,"\nGreenberg said. "Because a commitment is a commitment he lived up to his, made\nthe 3 hr drive, and appeared. Promoting and pricing were up to the club."\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by CompareCards\n\n  * ### 9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt\n\n  * ### Transfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 2021\n\n  * ### Fly practically free with these 3 travel cards\n\n  * ### Getting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent credit\n\n## Content by LendingTree\n\n  * ### How to pay off your house ASAP (It\'s so simple)\n\n  * ### Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1,608/mo\n\n  * ### Need cash?

That could value the company at nearly $12 billion.\n\nStill, that is less than some recent private valuations of the company.\n\nThe IPO by Pinterest would follow the recent public offering by ride-hailing\nservice Lyft (LYFT). Several other privately held start-ups worth at least $1\nbillion are also preparing offerings later this year, including Uber, Slack\nand Postmates.\n\nPinterest plans to sell 86.3 million shares as part of its initial offering,\nwhich would raise between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.\n\nPinterest files to go public. Its not-so-secret weapon: Moms\n\nThe company was founded in 2010 by Ben Silbermann, Evan Sharp and Paul\nSciarra, the last of whom parted ways with the company early in its history.\nOver the years, Pinterest has tried to evolve from being a digital\nscrapbooking service to a visual discovery tool, positioning it as a potential\ncompetitor to products like Google Search.\n\nRead More\n\nMore than 250 million people now use Pinterest each month to bookmark or "pin"\nimages ranging from recipes to home designs. While it\'s an impressive figure\nby many standards, it falls well behind other social platforms like Facebook\nand Instagram, which measure their audience in billions.\n\nUnlike Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Snapchat, Pinterest is not disclosing\nthe number of people who use its service on a daily basis, which could raise\nconcerns about user engagement. "We do not anticipate that most of our users\nwill become daily active users," the company said in its IPO prospectus.\n\nPinterest posted $766 million in sales last year, an increase of 60% from the\nyear prior, fueled by its advertising business. But like many other start-ups\nplanning IPOs, it has never reported a profit. It lost $63 million last year,\nthough that was smaller than earlier annual losses. It\'s also considerably\nless than $911 million and $1.8 billion lost last year by Lyft and Uber,\nrespectively.\n\nThis IPO market is nothing like late 1990s craziness\n\nLyft (LYFT) went public on March 29 with an IPO price of $72, but it has\nstruggled to remain above that price many days since the first trade. It\'s\nrelative weak early performance may have put a damper on the initial pricing\nrange offered by Pinterest.\n\n"It didn\'t help," said Matt Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, which\nmanages IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. The mixed reception to Lyft\'s Wall\nStreet debut "showed that public investors are somewhat cautious toward highly\nvalued, unprofitable companies."\n\nPinterest expects to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock\nticker "PINS."\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by SmartAsset\n\n  * ### These are your 3 financial advisors near you\n\n  * ### This site finds and compares 3 financial advisors in your area\n\n  * ### Check this off your list before retirement: talk to an advisor\n\n  * ### Answer these questions to find the right financial advisor for you\n\n  * ### Find CFPs in your area in 5 minutes\n\n  * \n\n  1.

That could value the company at nearly $12 billion.\n\nStill, that is less than some recent private valuations of the company.\n\nThe IPO by Pinterest would follow the recent public offering by ride-hailing\nservice Lyft (LYFT). Several other privately held start-ups worth at least $1\nbillion are also preparing offerings later this year, including Uber, Slack\nand Postmates.\n\nPinterest plans to sell 86.3 million shares as part of its initial offering,\nwhich would raise between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.\n\nPinterest files to go public. Its not-so-secret weapon: Moms\n\nThe company was founded in 2010 by Ben Silbermann, Evan Sharp and Paul\nSciarra, the last of whom parted ways with the company early in its history.\nOver the years, Pinterest has tried to evolve from being a digital\nscrapbooking service to a visual discovery tool, positioning it as a potential\ncompetitor to products like Google Search.\n\nRead More\n\nMore than 250 million people now use Pinterest each month to bookmark or "pin"\nimages ranging from recipes to home designs. While it\'s an impressive figure\nby many standards, it falls well behind other social platforms like Facebook\nand Instagram, which measure their audience in billions.\n\nUnlike Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Snapchat, Pinterest is not disclosing\nthe number of people who use its service on a daily basis, which could raise\nconcerns about user engagement. "We do not anticipate that most of our users\nwill become daily active users," the company said in its IPO prospectus.\n\nPinterest posted $766 million in sales last year, an increase of 60% from the\nyear prior, fueled by its advertising business. But like many other start-ups\nplanning IPOs, it has never reported a profit. It lost $63 million last year,\nthough that was smaller than earlier annual losses. It\'s also considerably\nless than $911 million and $1.8 billion lost last year by Lyft and Uber,\nrespectively.\n\nThis IPO market is nothing like late 1990s craziness\n\nLyft (LYFT) went public on March 29 with an IPO price of $72, but it has\nstruggled to remain above that price many days since the first trade. It\'s\nrelative weak early performance may have put a damper on the initial pricing\nrange offered by Pinterest.\n\n"It didn\'t help," said Matt Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, which\nmanages IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. The mixed reception to Lyft\'s Wall\nStreet debut "showed that public investors are somewhat cautious toward highly\nvalued, unprofitable companies."\n\nPinterest expects to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock\nticker "PINS."\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by SmartAsset\n\n  * ### These are your 3 financial advisors near you\n\n  * ### This site finds and compares 3 financial advisors in your area\n\n  * ### Check this off your list before retirement: talk to an advisor\n\n  * ### Answer these questions to find the right financial advisor for you\n\n  * ### Find CFPs in your area in 5 minutes\n\n  * \n\n  1.

Content related to terrorism\nand child abuse would face even stricter standards.\n\nCompanies would be required to "take reasonable and proportionate action" to\naddress objectionable content on their platforms, the government said in a\nstatement. A "code of practice" would include measures to minimize the spread\n"of misleading and harmful disinformation with dedicated fact checkers,\nparticularly during election periods," it added.\n\nWhy the UK is moving to regulate the internet\n\nEurope has taken a much more robust approach to tech regulation than the\nUnited States, confronting industry giants over competition issues, data\nprotection, privacy and tax. Calls for stricter regulation have increased\nrecently in the United Kingdom after social media was blamed for the suicide\nof a British teenager and Facebook failed to stop the live broadcast of a mass\nkilling in New Zealand.\n\nRead More\n\n"For too long these companies have not done enough to protect users,\nespecially children and young people, from harmful content," Prime Minister\nTheresa May said in a statement. "That is not good enough, and it is time to\ndo things differently."\n\nThe United Kingdom is casting a wide net. The plan, which the government will\ncontinue to develop over the next 12 weeks before proposing as legislation,\nextends to any company that "allows users to share or discover user generated\ncontent or interact with each other."\n\nThat would include Twitter (TWTR) and Google (GOOGL) video platform YouTube,\nbut also popular internet message boards such as Reddit.\n\nThe companies would be required to have an easy and effective complaints\nfunction, where users would "receive timely, clear and transparent responses\nto their complaints." Social media firms would also be forced to publish\nannual reports on the amount of harmful content on their platforms and explain\nwhat they were doing to address the issue.\n\nFacebook\'s Mark Zuckerberg calls for more regulation of the internet\n\nThe government said that the new regulator would be empowered to block access\nto websites or apps that break the rules, thereby disrupting their business\nmodels.\n\nIt also said that a "range of options" were being considered for subjecting\nindividual senior managers to civil fines and criminal liability. The proposal\nsuggested that rules governing executives in the financial services industry\ncould be used as a model.\n\n### Tech response\n\nKent Walker, senior vice president at Google, wrote in a blog post earlier\nthis year that the company was seeking to address illegal and harmful content\nby increasing transparency and working with regulators.\n\nFacebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in March that governments and\nregulators should play a "more active role" online. But he said that a global\napproach was needed to ensure that "the Internet does not get fractured" and\n"entrepreneurs can build products that serve everyone."\n\n"Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I\nagree," he wrote in the Washington Post. "I\'ve come to believe that we\nshouldn\'t make so many important decisions about speech on our own."\n\nRebecca Stimson, Facebook\'s head of UK public policy, said Monday that new\nrules should support innovation, the digital economy and freedom of speech.\n"These are complex issues to get right and we look forward to working with the\n[UK] government and parliament to ensure new regulations are effective," she\nsaid in a statement.\n\nTwitter\'s UK head of public policy Katy Minshall said in a statement on Monday\nthat the company is "deeply committed" to the safety of its users, touting\nwhat she said are "70 changes to our policies and processes last year."\n\n"We look forward to engaging in the next steps of the process, and working to\nstrike an appropriate balance between keeping users safe and preserving the\nopen, free nature of the internet," Minshall said.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by SmartAsset\n\n  * ### These are your 3 financial advisors near you\n\n  * ### This site finds and compares 3 financial advisors in your area\n\n  * ### Check this off your list before retirement: talk to an advisor\n\n  * ### Answer these questions to find the right financial advisor for you\n\n  * ### Find CFPs in your area in 5 minutes\n\n  * \n\n  1.

Knowing the drill, I wasn\'t surprised to hear I had 24\nhours to respond before going to jail.\n\nRead More\n\nWhat you can do right now to stop robocalls\n\nI get more scam calls than actual calls \xe2\x80\x94 after all, nearly 30% of all calls\nmade each day are robocalls \xe2\x80\x94 but a call from my own number was a new one for\nme.\n\nYet some experts warn this is just a mild taste of bigger dangers to come: a\nworld where you receive robocalls calls from numbers you recognize and the\nperson on the other end sounds like someone you know.\n\nSpoofing, a form of robo-calling, is increasingly common. It\'s when someone\nmakes a call from a voice-over-IP service, such as Skype, and are able to\nenter a host number. While a carrier must provide a number when a call is made\nfrom a cell phone or landline, any number sequence can be entered via a VoIP\nservice, whether it\'s a made up number, a number in your address book, or one\nfrom the White House. It\'s so easy, anyone could do it.\n\nBecause a scammer knows you\'re more likely to pick up if you recognize the\ncaller, they might enter a number they think is in your address book. They\ncould even one day use voice manipulation technology to impersonate that\nperson. (Think deepfakes for robocalls).\n\nTarun Wadhwa, founder of tech advisory firm Day One Insights, argues that it\'s\neasy for strangers to find out who is close to you and what their personal\ndetails are from social media or other websites. Years of large-scale data\nbreaches have exposed millions of people\'s phone numbers, addresses, passwords\nand credit card information online, making it easier for them to be pulled\ninto a scheme.\n\n"It\'s going to be like Photoshop \xe2\x80\x94 something so easy, widespread, and well\nknown that we stop tracking how it\'s being used against people personally and\ndon\'t find it surprising," said Wadhwa, who\'s spent years studying issues\nrelated to identity, forgery technologies and cybersecurity.\n\nWadhwa worries this type of forgery technologies could also ruin relationships\nand reputations.\n\n"I can easily imagine situations in which these sorts of voice-mimicry\ntechnologies are used to sow confusion, extort people and make fraud and scams\nfar more precise," he said.\n\nWatch out, Alexa. Artificial voices are starting to sound just like humans\n\nSome startups are already working on voice manipulation technology. Others are\nusing AI to generate voices that can banter just like real humans.\n\nLast year, Google showed off its AI-powered Duplex assistant that showed how a\nperson could make dinner reservations over the phone without knowing the\nreceptionist wasn\'t a person. The technology, which sounded alarmingly\nrealistic and could keep the conversation going with the caller, caused a\nstir. Critics are concerned it\'ll be hard for the average person to\ndifferentiate who\'s real and not on the phone, blurring the line between\nautomated and authentic conversations.\n\nBut Alex Quilici, CEO of robocall-prevention app YouMail, said it will take\nsubstantial work on the scammer\'s end to make this happen.\n\n"Building a fake computer voice right now is a decent amount of work," Quilici\nsaid. "If I wanted to build one that sounded like you, for example, I\'d need\nto get a ton of samples of you saying specific phonemes, and train a computer\nmodel on that."\n\nHe argues easier, yet still sophisticated, spoofing might entail getting a\ncall from a friend\'s number saying they\'re in jail and you need to bail them\nout. Or it could mean a call from your child\'s number from someone pretending\nto be a doctor, asking you to come to the hospital \xe2\x80\x94 only to be burglarized\nwhen you\'re out.\n\nThese concerns come at a time when robocalls are more rampant than ever and\nfewer people are picking up calls from unknown numbers. Americans received\n26.3 billion robocalls last year \xe2\x80\x94 a 46% surge from 2017 \xe2\x80\x94 and this March\nalone set a new monthly record with 5.23 billion robocalls, according to data\nfrom YouMail. Meanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission says unwanted\ncalls are the biggest consumer complaint made to the agency each year. (It\nreceived 7.1 million complaints about robocalls in 2017).\n\nThese people do not exist. Why websites are churning out fake images of people\n(and cats)\n\nI typically don\'t answer calls from unknown numbers, but the one from myself\nwas hard to resist. According to Quilici, even just picking up the phone may\nbe a mistake. Answering a robocall lets scammers know my number is active and\nthat I am willing to pick up.\n\n"Spoofing is becoming more and more common as scammers try to call with\nnumbers that are less likely to be blocked," he said. "You\'re not blocking\nyour own number, and you are more likely to answer numbers that look local."\n\nThe FCC\'s efforts to crack down on robocalls have been slow moving. In\nNovember 2018, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai sent letters to carriers, including\nVerizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, to encourage them to embrace a caller\nauthentication framework.\n\n"Combating illegal robocalls is our top consumer priority at the FCC," Pai\nsaid in a statement. "That\'s why we need call authentication to become a\nreality \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s the best way to ensure that consumers can answer their phones\nwith confidence. By this time next year, I expect that consumers will begin to\nsee this on their phones."\n\nThe telecom industry is working on a tool called Stir/Shaken to identify and\ntrace spoofing efforts could have the biggest potential to curb robocalls.\nAT&T, Comcast and Verizon have already completed tests, and other providers\nhave pledged to embrace Stir/Shaken by the end of 2019. (AT&T owns CNN\'s\nparent company, WarnerMedia.)\n\nBut because it involves massive crossover \xe2\x80\x94 a person using an AT&T wireless\nphone will need to be verified when they call a Comcast landline \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s a\nchallenging technical undertaking. Some experts like Wadhwa worry the\nsolutions could be somewhat obsolete by the time they hit the market.\n\nLawmakers warn of \'deepfake\' videos ahead of 2020 election\n\nIn the meantime, robo-blocking apps like YouMail can play an out-of-service\nmessage when a known robo-number comes in. The message makes it seem like your\nnumber is disconnected, so scammers won\'t call you back. Meanwhile, carriers\nlike Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile offer free-to-download apps that auto-block\nthese types of calls. For a monthly charge of several dollars, the apps can\nreverse lookup the caller.\n\nRobocalling scammers rely on cheap technology that works on a large scale, but\nnew schemes could get smarter and pose an even bigger threat in the future.\n\n"If we don\'t get a hold on this, I believe we\'ll look back on robocalls as a\nmuch easier problem to deal with than what\'s coming down the pipeline," Wadhwa\nsaid.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n## Content by SmartAsset\n\n  * ### These are your 3 financial advisors near you\n\n  * ### This site finds and compares 3 financial advisors in your area\n\n  * ### Check this off your list before retirement: talk to an advisor\n\n  * ### Answer these questions to find the right financial advisor for you\n\n  * ### Find CFPs in your area in 5 minutes\n\n  * \n\n  1.

It was organized by the\nLos Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable.\n\nRapper was more movement than musician\n\n"Here was a young man who was not exclusively about the bling, flash, cash,\ncars, party, fun, and the fast life. Here was a guy who had his head screwed\non right and was giving back to the community by investing in the community,"\nEarl Ofari Hutchinson, the group\'s president, wrote in a column after his\ndeath.\n\nA gunman killed Nipsey Hussle on March 31, police say.\n\nA candlelit vigil at Alexander Hamilton High School in the Castle Heights\nneighborhood Sunday featured more than 200 of the school\'s alumni, fans of his\nmusic and other members of the community. The Grammy-nominated rhymesmith\nbriefly attended school there before dropping out at age 15 to pursue his\nmusical career.\n\nRead More\n\nMourners placed candles and photos of the rapper on the school\'s steps. Gold\nballoons that hung in front of a school door spelled out, "Farewell." Several\nof the people who spoke at the vigil shared stories of meeting the rapper, who\nthey say was always accessible, and they explained how his love for the\ncommunity touched them.\n\n"I had the pleasure of meeting him back in 2004," said Hamilton alum Tamiko\nCarson, according to CNN affiliate KABC. "I was shopping at Target and we just\nstarted talking, and he was just such an amazing young man. The mark he left\non this world, it will never be replaceable. There will never be another\nperson who can match what he\'s done."\n\n> Former Hamilton High students hold a candlelight vigil for slain rapper\nNipsey Hussle.

The vigil ended with the release of blue balloons in\nhonor of the rapper, as his song "Dedication" played in the background. In the\nsong, Nipsey discusses his commitment to achieving his goals despite his\ncircumstances.\n\nThe tributes follow a coast-to-coast outpouring of love for the Eritrean-\nAmerican rapper, who was respected not only for his artistry but for his\ndevotion to the Crenshaw District where he grew up. He owned businesses there,\ninvested in the community and counted several Los Angeles rappers among his\ninfluences and collaborators.\n\nTwo of his mixtapes -- "Slauson Boy Vol. 1" and "Crenshaw" -- took their names\nfrom the area. The Marathon Clothing store sits near West Slauson Avenue and\nCrenshaw Boulevard.\n\nBoth police officers and rival street gangs were saddened by his death. Nipsey\nhad reached out to the Los Angeles Police Department to request a meeting to\ndiscuss ways to curb gang violence and help children, police said following\nnews that he\'d been killed.\n\n> View this post on Instagram\n\n>\n\n> The #NIPSEYHUSSLE. / Developing OPTIONS UNITY WALK ....... were asking each\nPERSON who comes Please come with the Right HEART !!

The\nshooting came after a dispute between Holder and the rapper and does not\nappear gang-related, the chief said.\n\nHolder pleaded not guilty Thursday to a charge of murder and two counts of\nattempted murder, the Los Angeles County District Attorney\'s Office said. He\nwas also charged at his arraignment with possession of a firearm by a felon.\n\n### JUST WATCHED\n\n## Nipsey Hussle shooting shown on surveillance video\n\nReplay\n\nMore Videos ...\n\n#### MUST WATCH\n\nNipsey Hussle shooting shown on surveillance video 03:07\n\nCNN\'s attempts to reach Holder\'s attorney were unsuccessful.

At one point, Holder left, returned with a\nhandgun and "purposely and repeatedly fired" at the men, injuring two of them\nand killing the rapper, the chief said.\n\nSorrowful tributes poured forth, with John Legend, J.
